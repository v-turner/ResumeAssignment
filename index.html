        <p>I am a student passionate about visual storytelling, both digitally and hands-on. Through my studies, my coursework has provided me with a mix of graphic design principles, such as typography, color theory, and layout design along with web development and web design fundamentals, including HTML and CSS. It is fascinating to experience creating real-world projects that will only enhance my skills as I continue to learn and grow.</p>
